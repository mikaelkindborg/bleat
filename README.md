Bleat (Blutooth Low Energy Abstraction Tool) provides a simplified BLE layer which uses adapters to abstract the usage of BLE in JavaScript on different platforms.

Follows the [Web Bluetooth](https://webbluetoothcg.github.io/web-bluetooth/) API specification.

## Installation

```
npm install bleat
      -or-
bower install bleat
```

## Usage

The main `bleat.core.js` file offers the BLE layer while each `bleat.<platform>.js` file represents an adapter.
The `bleat.js` file contains the BLE layer and all adapters concatenated together (not minified).
The `bleat.min.js` file is a minified version of the BLE layer and all adapters.

Files follow the UMD (https://github.com/umdjs/umd), so should work with AMD (requirejs), CommonJS (node) and plain JavaScript projects.

Refer to the `example_<adapter>` files for simple examples.

### Plain JavaScript (globals)

Include (or require) the `bleat.core.js` file before the adapter you wish to use or include the minified file offering all adapters.

e.g.

```
<script src="path/to/bleat.core.js"></script>
<script src="path/to/bleat.<adapter>.js"></script>
```

### Node.js

Simply require it up!

```
var bleat = require('bleat');
```
